# Implementation-of-Apriori-and-FP-Growth-Algorithm
Frequent itemset mining.
janet here like to make a change because Apriori algorithm is based on the fact that if a subset S appear K times,any other subset S that contain S will appear k times or less.
if S doesn,t pass the minium support threshold,neither does S

There is no need to calculate S

it is discarded apriori.
